# python-api-challenge
Using Python request, APIs, and JSON traversals to analyze and forecast weather predictions. 
The question being asked in this assignment is: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"
I wanted to push beyond answer the question with the obvious "It gets hotter" response. Instead I used this assignment to do a deeper dive into the data
After creating my respository and cloning the same locally
I created the varius folders that would hold the two dataset "VacationPy and WeatherPy that I would use for this analysis
I reviewed the CSV to view the dataset before importing to Jupyter Notebook for further analysis
I began my analysis by using the following methods using OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data
I created Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship as it pertained to the weather and wrote my conclusion based on there relationships

in the next deliverable, I used the weather data analysis to plan future vacations using Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
I was able to compute the linear regression for each of the parameters: Creating Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude and Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship

Note: I had to research and read the various API documentations for to structure code and had help from intructer and TA's to clarify errors.
